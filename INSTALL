Supported Platforms:
ubuntu 12.04 64 bit
Mac OS X 10.6.8 64 bit


There are the required dependencies for ubuntu 12.04.
sudo apt-get install cmake git python2.7-dev g++-4.6 gcc-4.6 gfortran-4.6 make tcl8.5-dev python2.7 flex bison tcl8.5

For Mac OS X, the developer tools should be installed (Xcode 3.2.6), these contain all the necessary libraries.  The math libraries are from the Apple Accelerate Framework.  Note that a FORTRAN compiler is not required.

For Mac OS X, Python 2.7.3 is required and may be downloaded from 
http://www.python.org/download

Note that the -j2 option for make and ctest is for building and testing in 2 parallel threads.  This number can be changed to run as many simultaneous processes as desired.

Download DEVSIM:
1. git clone git://github.com/devsim/devsim.git
2. cd devsim
3. git submodule init
